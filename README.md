# Book inventory Spring boot app #

Spring Boot based implementation of a minimalist book inventory app to represent a possible module architecture.
This app offers basic CRUD functionality and some search functionality for handling books via book title and author.
The book entities are persisted in an underlying SQL database (in memory) for the sake of simplicity.
On the creation of a new Book it is registered via an imaginary 3rd party "register book" endpoint returning with an isbn number.
